		If you are interested in mastering the art of front-end development, look no further. This course is the complete beginners guide to developing cutting-edge web pages that are fully mobile responsive.

		The course branches into three sections. We start by exploring HTML5, students learn the composition of a web page and how a web browser interprets html code to display the visual elements of a page. We cover just about every aspect of HTML syntax, to ensure you are well prepared for the remaining sections ahead.
		The HTML sections covers the following key concepts:

		HTML Page Structure<br>
		
		Working with Spacing<br>

		Inserting Images & Videos<br>
		
		Creating Links and Anchor Tags<br>
		
		Inserting Tabular Data & Tables<br>
		
		Creating Forms<br>
		
		+ Much More<br>
		
		Once students have a firm grasp on HTML coding, we move right into CSS. Here, students will learn to add stunning design elements to really make web pages visually aesthetic. We will also cover a broad range of CSS attributes to make web pages completely mobile responsive, even on the trickiest of devices such as phones and tablets.

JavaScript is an extremely powerful front-end programming language that can really help take web pages to another level. This section teaches students how to add client-side validation to forms, animate images and objects, and manipulate both HTML and CSS elements using the DOM (Document Object Model).
